# f1_regressor
The project aims to develop a random forest ensemble regression model that can predict outcomes using time-series-like Formula 1 (F1) race data. Given the criticality of every point in the F1 world championship, the goal is to determine, beforehand, which drivers are likely to finish in the top ten.
